### Server Side Rendering

- Server Side Rendering or SSR is the process of taking all the code from a website that is usually loaded in the browser (client-side),
 and rendering them as static on the server side (nodejs). Making the whole page load at once.
 - With that we can obtain a website with a reduced loading time and fully indexable by SEOâ€™s.
